Most of today was spent detailing workflow and delegating work to different members. The issue i'm currently working on is creating the Company table and its endpoints.

Starting today, I have a working Company table. It exists in its own migration file, which we may decide to combine with other tables so that we can reference them when needed.

By the end of today, all CRUD endpoints for Company are functioning, and the table is working as well. I've completed the merge request to merge to main.

I've added Company to the frontend, creating a path in the React App to show the table data from the Company table.
I've also changed the Company table to exclude a position_id, because we're flipping our logic to join Company to the Positions Table.

Visx and d-3 have also been installed.

Week 15

Over the weekend, I spent a long time getting familiar with TailwindCSS. I was able to make some design decisions on the nav bar and the dashboard, which included consistent color palettes and shapes. I've also created a functioning dashboard table that displays available positions grouped by their company. A user can also direct to the company detail page from that companny table.

Today, I'm working on introducing a darkmode toggling functionality. I'm following resources from TailwindCSS, and if implemented successfully, can be applied to the whole application.

I also tackled the Topics backend. I created the table migrations and made all the endpoints.
The joins have not been written yet, which are essential to the topics page, as we will need to connect users and comments to posts.

Today, I'm finalizing the dark mode color palette. I would like to hammer out the containers/sections layout of the dashboard as well. keeping the layout nice and pretty has been a struggling point for me. By the end of the day, we should also have front end auth too.

I separated the "Know Your Worth" banner to it's own file to clean up the component organization.
