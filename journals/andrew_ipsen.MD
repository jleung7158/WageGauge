Most of today was spent detailing workflow and delegating work to different members. The issue i'm currently working on is creating the Company table and its endpoints.

Starting today, I have a working Company table. It exists in its own migration file, which we may decide to combine with other tables so that we can reference them when needed.

<<<<<<< HEAD
By the end of today, all CRUD endpoints for Company are functioning, and the table is working as well. I've completed the merge request to merge to main.

I'd like to solidify the endpoints for the Company model, and get Beekeeper Studio set up so I can use it.
