Today, I worked on a Position model that will be assigned to various companies. I also started on a simple React page for the company detail (no content, just framework).
The Position model will have the title of the position, the position level in the company, the years in that position, an optional notes field on their journey in that position, and a small description of the job as the fields. Each position will have a list of salaries attached to it, to calculate statistics and data.
The React page will have a sidebar with a list of positions in that company, with a sort and search function. Clicking on one position will bring up graphical data for the position, which will be over a 5 year time span, and be seperated by the level of that position.

A list of features/issues that you worked on and who you worked with, if applicable
A reflection on any design conversations that you had
At least one ah-ha! moment that you had during your coding, however small

I need to discuss with the group about how to implement the salary though.

As for aha! moments, I had one while coding the FastAPI routers: they basically combine the views and urls together from django!

Today, I added Tailwind CSS to our React app. It should be fun to use for styling. I started on a simple React page for the company detail (no content, just framework) and will be messing around with styling for the rest of the day.

The React page will have a sidebar with a list of positions in that company, with a sort and search function. Clicking on one position will bring up graphical data for the position, which will be over a 5 year time span, and be seperated by the level of that position.

We didn't discuss much, and as for aha! moments I basically only had one noticeable one for Tailwind: no need for huge custom css classes.

Today, I'm working on adjusting my positions database to account for company SQL JOIN's as well as more styling via Tailwind.

We discussed how specifically to implement the positions and company databases to help with the salary db.

As for aha! moments, not many today. It was cool to see how h-screen works in Tailwind I guess?

Today I'm working on solving more joins for our database and more styling. We're going to join employee with company and position. We also resolved merge conflicts.

We discussed future organizational methods to reduce future method conflicts.

As for aha! moments, I figured out how to send data via props with a button click, so that was cool.
