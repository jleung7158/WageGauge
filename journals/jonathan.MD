Over the weekend I spent time reading about unit testing. Today I plan to work on showing the list of former positions per account.

We are working on deployment of the front-end today. Ideally we will have the entire project deployed today. After this is done I will continue working on displaying the list of former positions.

Finshing up deployement of both the front-end and back-end. Adding unit testing for employees by the end of the day.

Will spend most of the day wrapping up all loose ends for our presentation. Last checks before final deployment. Fixed pathing issue with to AccountCompanyList on the nav bar. The data base must be populated with employees. I am doing this to have data to display on the front-end for our presentation.
